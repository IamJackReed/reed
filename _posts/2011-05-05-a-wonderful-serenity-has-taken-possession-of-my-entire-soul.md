# **ABCDEF**

## **Intro**
Scrum Masters and Agile Coaches spend much of their time helping individuals, teams, and leaders navigate uncertainty, conflict, and change. Often the biggest blockers to progress are not processes or frameworks, they are the self-limiting beliefs people hold about themselves or their environment. The **ABCDEF model** is a powerful, structured coaching tool rooted in cognitive-behavioural theory that helps challenge and reframe these beliefs.

Originally developed as the **ABCDE** model within **Rational Emotive Behaviour Therapy (REBT)** by psychologist Albert Ellis (1962), the framework has since been adapted for coaching contexts, with an added **F** stage to reinforce the emotional shift that comes from adopting healthier beliefs. In Agile environments, where psychological flexibility, empiricism, and continuous improvement are key, this tool fits naturally into developmental conversations at all levels of an organisation.

## **1. What Is the ABCDEF model?**
The ABCDEF model is a **cognitive-behavioural coaching framework** that helps individuals identify, examine, and ultimately reframe unhelpful or self-limiting beliefs. It divides the conversation into two halves:

- **A–C:** Understanding the present situation and beliefs  
- **D–F:** Challenging and replacing unhelpful beliefs with more effective ones  

Used well, the model creates insight, builds emotional resilience, and encourages growth, all essential attributes for high-performing teams.

## **2. Origins of the Model**
The ABCDEF tool has its roots in **Rational Emotive Behaviour Therapy (REBT)**, developed by **Albert Ellis** in the 1950s and formalised in the 1960s (Ellis, 1962). The original **ABCDE** sequence described how:
- **A**ctivating events trigger  
- **B**eliefs, which lead to  
- **C**onsequences (emotional and behavioural), and  
- **D**isputing irrational beliefs leads to  
- **E**ffective new beliefs  

Modern coaching practice often adds:
- **F** – **New Feelings** arising from the shift in mindset  

This extension is widely used in executive and performance coaching to create a stronger link between cognitive reframing and emotional experience (Passmore & Nguyen, 2019).

## **3. How to Use the Tool**
During a coaching conversation, guide your client through the six stages:

### **A — Activating Event or Situation**
Identify the triggering scenario.  
*Example: “I need to present the sprint goals to senior leadership.”*

### **B — Beliefs (Often Self-Limiting)**
Explore what the person tells themselves about the event.  
*“If I don’t present perfectly, they’ll think I’m incompetent.”*

### **C — Consequences**
Identify emotional, behavioural, or performance impacts.  
*Anxiety, avoidance, over-preparation, or reduced confidence.*
### **D — Disputing the Beliefs**

Gently challenge the accuracy, usefulness, and rationality of the beliefs:

- *“What evidence supports this belief?”*  
- *“What’s the worst that could realistically happen?”*  
- *“How is this belief helping or hindering you?”*

### **E — Effective New Beliefs**
Encourage the person to develop healthier, more productive beliefs.  
*“This presentation is an opportunity to engage people and share value.”*

### **F — New Feelings**
Identify the emotional shifts associated with the new beliefs.  
*Increased confidence, reduced anxiety, a sense of challenge rather than threat.*

## **4. Examples in Agile & Scrum Contexts**
Here are practical scenarios showing how the ABCDEF model benefits Agile Coaches and Scrum Masters at multiple levels of an organisation.

### **A. Helping a Developer Afraid of Pair Programming**
- **A:** Team introduces pair programming.  
- **B:** “Others will think I’m slow or not good enough.”  
- **C:** Avoids pairing, works in isolation.  
- **D:** Challenge assumptions: “What feedback have you actually received?”  
- **E:** “Pairing is a way to learn and produce better code.”  
- **F:** More open, collaborative, willing to try.  

### **B. Improving Leadership Engagement in an Agile Transformation**
- **A:** Leadership asked to attend sprint reviews.  
- **B:** “This is a waste of my time; the team won’t benefit.”  
- **C:** Leaders disengage; teams feel unsupported.  
- **D:** Explore organisational impact: “What message does non-attendance send?”  
- **E:** “My presence reinforces alignment and psychological safety.”  
- **F:** Leaders become more intentionally involved.  

### **C. Coaching a Product Owner Struggling with Stakeholder Conflict**
- **A:** PO must negotiate priorities with demanding stakeholders.  
- **B:** “If I push back, they’ll be angry or escalate.”  
- **C:** Over-commits the team; scope inflation; stress.  
- **D:** Review evidence: “When have you negotiated successfully before?”  
- **E:** “Clear boundaries lead to better outcomes for everyone.”  
- **F:** Increased certainty and assertiveness.  

### **D. Supporting a Team New to Scrum Ceremonies**
- **A:** First retrospective approaching.  
- **B:** “We shouldn’t discuss problems; it will create conflict.”  
- **C:** Shallow discussions, no transparency.  
- **D:** Reframe: “Psychological safety is built through honesty.”  
- **E:** “Retrospectives help us grow without blame.”  
- **F:** Team becomes more open and trusting.

## **5. Summary**
The ABCDEF model provides Scrum Masters and Agile Coaches with a practical, psychologically grounded method for helping individuals reshape limiting beliefs and unlock more effective behaviours. By supporting emotional resilience and cognitive flexibility, the model strengthens team dynamics, enhances collaboration, and reinforces a culture of continuous improvement across the organisation.
