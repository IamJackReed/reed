title: Driving Faster Doesn’t Mean You’re Going Somewhere
subtitle: Why real agility isn’t about speed — it’s about sensing, slack, and value.

  and the difference between moving fast and actually going somewhere meaningful.

I once sat in a meeting where someone cheerfully announced that we needed to *“accelerate our agile journey.”*  
Nobody questioned the sentence — which, if you think about it, is suspicious. Like saying *“we need to breathe more oxygen to breathe better.”*  
This is how a lot of organisations approach *agile*: **faster, faster, faster**, as if the system is a racetrack, the people are Formula 1 drivers, and the product backlog is a series of increasingly stressful hairpin turns.

But anyone who’s spent time thinking about complexity (Ackoff), systems variation (Deming), or change (Kotter) knows:  
**Speed doesn’t guarantee progress. Sometimes it only accelerates confusion.**

## The Illusion of Speed

Teams sprint. Velocity charts slope neatly downward. Boards look satisfyingly green.  
And yet someone inevitably asks:

> “Yes… but what value did we actually deliver?”

It’s like driving at 90 mph down a motorway while ignoring every signpost.  
Agile isn’t meant to be a blur of motion — it’s meant to be a method of *sense-making*. One that helps humans navigate complexity rather than drown in it.

This is where the **Yerkes–Dodson law** quietly taps you on the shoulder. A little pressure sharpens us; too much pressure turns us into a chaotic bag of cortisol and guesswork.  
Run a team at 100% utilisation and you’ll get the same result you’d get from boiling pasta on maximum heat: a starchy explosion, now stuck to the ceiling.

## Slack, Autonomy & the Art of Actually Knowing What’s Going On

Systems thinkers get twitchy when they hear phrases like “keep people fully utilised.”  
Deming told us that overloading a system increases variation. Ackoff would remind us that purposeful systems require time to reflect on purpose.

Slack isn’t indulgence.  
Slack is **your ability to notice reality**.

A team without slack is like a sailor who’s taped open their eyelids so they can stare directly at the sails: very alert, very committed, and very doomed.

Autonomy works the same way. Not “you do you” chaos, but the kind that lets a team notice, learn, decide, and adapt.  
A team that always has to escalate decisions is like a satnav that needs permission to recalculate the route.

## Outcomes Over Outputs (The Ancient Battle)

Scrum.org calls this out repeatedly: **outputs are not outcomes**.

Shipping 10 features means nothing if none of them shift behaviour, improve flow, help a user, or reduce risk.  
If anything, more features often mean more maintenance, more complexity, more potential for chaos.

As Ackoff famously said:

> *“Managers who don’t know how to measure what they want settle for wanting what they can measure.”*

Velocity is easy to measure.  
Value is harder.  
That’s why the former is printed on dashboards and the latter is printed on PowerPoint slides after the fact.

Ever heard of **Cost of Delay**?  
It’s the difference between delivering something that matters *now* and delivering something irrelevant *perfectly on time*.  
A team optimising for speed alone will miss windows of opportunity as efficiently as possible.

## The Human System: Messy, Brilliant, Unpredictable

Scrum Masters quickly learn a secret: it’s never really about the process.  
It’s about the dynamics *under* the process.

Biases.  
Safety.  
Trust.  
Cross-team dependencies.  
The quiet politics of influence.  
The system surrounding the team — not the team itself — explains most variation.

Stewart Lee might say something like:

*“At this point the organisation wants to be more agile — which is impressive, because they’ve still not decided what they actually want.”*

The job isn’t to enforce rituals.  
The job is to help a team become a *purposeful system* that can sense, think, and act.

## Some Practical Nudges (Without the Agile Pom-Poms)

Try these:

* Ask your team at the end of a day: “What did we learn that changes what we’ll do tomorrow?”
* Block an hour every sprint that *cannot* be used for delivery — only reflection, observation, or alignment.
* In sprint reviews: “How did this increment deliver value?” Not: “How many stories closed?”
* In retros: “What system forces shaped our decisions? Which ones can we influence?”

These aren’t rituals.  
They’re invitations to notice.

## Are You Moving Fast, or Are You Going Somewhere?

If your team is busy and efficient and everything’s “green” — great.  
But busyness is not progress. Efficiency is not learning. Motion is not purpose.

Real agility is a way of **seeing**, not a way of **speeding**.

Next time someone says, “We need to go faster,” just smile politely and ask:

> “Faster towards what?”

If the answer is silence, congratulations — you’ve just exposed a systems problem.

Now you can finally start doing the real work.
