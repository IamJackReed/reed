  <h1>Challenging Beliefs: Using the ABCDEF Model</h1>
  <p class="post-intro">
    I often underestimate how much of coaching work is about *belief engineering*.  
    The ABCDEF model, rooted in cognitive behavioural coaching, has quietly become one of my go-to tools for helping clients question not their backlog — but their mental model.

  ## **1. Description**
  I was working with a senior product lead in a large financial enterprise — a capable, articulate person who, by all observable metrics, was doing fine. Yet every time we discussed facilitating cross-team workshops, she’d recoil.  
  Her phrase: *“I’m not good in a room full of strong personalities.”*

  So, we paused delivery talk and unpacked that belief using the **ABCDEF model** — a structured way to trace how beliefs, not events, drive behaviour.

  ---
  
  ## **2. Feelings**
  Initially, I felt hesitant. Challenging beliefs can feel intrusive, even manipulative if done without care. There’s a fine line between facilitation and therapy.  
  But there was also curiosity — the kind that surfaces when a coach senses that progress isn’t blocked by frameworks or tooling, but by something far more human.

  The client’s tone carried both self-protection and resignation.  
  I felt responsible for creating a safe space to explore, not to convince.

  ---
  
  ## **3. Evaluation**
  Once we surfaced her **Activating event (A)** — the moment she’s asked to facilitate — and her **Belief (B)** — “strong personalities will dominate me” — the **Consequences (C)** became obvious: avoidance, tension, and missed opportunities for visibility.

  Using the model’s next stages — **Disputing (D)**, **Effective new beliefs (E)**, and **New feelings (F)** — we worked to test that assumption.  
  “Is that always true?” I asked. “Has it ever gone differently?”  
  It turns out, she’d run dozens of small workshops successfully. The belief wasn’t a truth — it was a generalisation frozen in time.

  </div>

  The outcome was subtle but important: she didn’t suddenly become fearless.  
  She simply started experimenting — first by co-facilitating, then by owning smaller sessions.  
  Each success provided new data, reinforcing a new loop of belief.

  ## **4. Analysis**
  The **ABCDEF model** is deceptively simple, yet systemically powerful.  
  It aligns closely with *double-loop learning* in organisational change: instead of asking “How do we improve behaviour?”, it asks “What belief system produces this behaviour?”

  In Agile environments — especially enterprises clinging to command-and-control — we often mistake resistance for personality. In reality, it’s *belief architecture*.  
  People act in line with what they believe keeps them safe.

  The model gives us a way to respectfully challenge those assumptions without moralising.  
  It doesn’t force “positivity”; it invites *accuracy*.

  ---
  
  ## **5. Conclusion**
  Through this reflection, I realised how important it is for coaches to hold a mirror to *thinking*, not just *doing*.  
  In startups, this happens naturally — everything’s experimental.  
  In large organisations, however, legacy beliefs are baked into governance, language, and structure.  
  Challenging those beliefs — whether in one person or across a programme — is what systemic coaching really means.

  The ABCDEF model provides a scaffold for that conversation: humane, structured, and disarmingly effective.

  ## **6. Action Plan**
  - Integrate the ABCDEF model into early coaching engagements where behavioural patterns emerge.  
  - Use it in retrospectives when emotional blockers surface — not to “fix people,” but to *surface thinking*.  
  - Document belief shifts as learning outcomes, not personal failures.  
  - Keep humour and humility at the centre. Beliefs shift through safety, not pressure.

  Next time a client says, *“That’s just the way I am,”* — I’ll remember: that’s not identity, that’s legacy code.
