          This site is where I dump signal:
          trading notes, experiments, things I’ve broken, things I’ve fixed,
          patterns that actually work in teams, and the occasional rant about delivery,
          risk, or attention.
        </p>

        <p>
          It’s not polished marketing content. It’s field notes.
          That means some of it will age badly, some of it will contradict other posts,
          and some of it will be uncomfortably honest.
        </p>

        <p>
          A couple of things this is <strong>not</strong>:
        </p>

        <ul class="about-list">
          <li>It’s not investment advice, trading advice, or career advice.</li>
          <li>It’s not “10 tips to get rich in 5 minutes.”</li>
          <li>It’s not sponsored, optimised for clicks, or pretending to be neutral.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          A couple of things this <strong>is</strong>:
        </p>

        <ul class="about-list">
          <li>Real situations from work, delivery, and markets.</li>
          <li>Notes on what I’d try again (and what I wouldn’t).</li>
          <li>Tools and patterns that help humans move faster without frying themselves.</li>
        </ul>

          If you want glossy, there are other sites. If you want actual thinking-in-progress,
          welcome.
