### What this is

This site is where I dump working ideas: trading notes, experiments in systems thinking,
things I’ve tried with teams, tech builds, and the occasional bad decision so you
don’t have to repeat it.

It’s not polished marketing. It’s a running lab book.

### What I actually do

- I work in delivery / product / org design.
- I care about cycle time, flow, feedback loops, and incentives.
- I build tools and visualisations that show why teams really slow down (hint: it’s almost never “the team”).

Outside work:
- Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, which is equal parts problem-solving and getting strangled.
- Writing about markets — not “get rich fast,” more “here’s what I’m watching and why.”

### Ground rules

Nothing on this site is financial advice, career advice, health advice, relationship advice, or legal advice.
It’s context, not instruction.

If you copy/paste something from here directly into your life, you own the consequences.
Cool? Cool.
